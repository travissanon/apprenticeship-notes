[Code Katas (Javascript & Ruby)](https://github.com/travissanon/code-katas) - I worked on some katas alone as well as some pair programming on a few TDD katas. 

[Ruby Koans](https://github.com/travissanon/koans) - Working through these Ruby koans is a terrific way to learn the Ruby language, syntax, and structure. Test driven development also played a bit part of these exercises.

# Projects üöß
[Ruby Hotdog Stand](https://github.com/corinneling/apprentice-hot-dog-stand) - This is our *first* Apprentice project. The task is to write a program which presents a questionnaire to the user asking them the particulars of a hot dog order inside the terminal.

[Front-End Event Card](https://codepen.io/DevMaterial/pen/ZoOxJY?editors=1100) - Our *second* Apprentice project. The task is to create an event card based off of our chosen design created by the Sparkbox Frontend Designers. The project has broken up into 5 parts.

Part 1 > HTML: Creating the skeleton of the event card.

Part 2 > CSS: Styling the event card with CSS.

Part 3 > Grid: Creating a grid layout for the event card(s) using [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) or [CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout). The layout should be responsive, mobile-first, and all content should be browser tested.

Part 4 > Sass: Replacing our CSS with Sass.

Part 5 > BEM: Incorporating BEM to any HTML and CSS that have been written.


[Sparkeats 2.0](https://eats.seesparkbox.com/) - Our *third* and final Apprentice poject. The task is to create a backend for the [previous Apprentice project](http://apprentices.seesparkbox.com/), Sparkeats, with the MVC framework [Sails.js](https://sailsjs.com/). *(in progress)*

[Ruby Warrior](https://www.bloc.io/ruby-warrior#/) - A pretty cool interative game to learn Ruby.

[Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/ruby/) - I *really really* like this tutoroal. Its easy to digest, doesnt hold your hand, and most importantly, Its informative. If I only had one option to learn Ruby, I would pick this.

## Phase 2 - Frontend Development
[BEM by Example](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/bem_by_example) - An article in the [Sparkbox Foundry](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/) written by [Nathan Rambeck](https://twitter.com/nrambeck) that explains the practice of BEM in a clear, cohesive writing style.

[Sass tutorials (Youtube - thenetninja)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St5B7hnMLjg&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iEwigam3gTjU_7IA3W2WZA) - A great in depth-tutorial on the various features Sass has to offer. Variables, mixins, math operators, this video series has most of what im looking for. 

[Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) / [CSS Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) - 
These two mini-games are great for not only learning flexbox and css grid, but applying what both technologies have to offer on elements to understand *what* certain properties/property combinations do and *how* its done.

[Flexbox Guide (CSS Tricks)](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I read through this guide whenever I get stuck with a flexbox related problem. It's very detailed and has almost everything I need to know about flexbox.

I couldnt find many up-to-date tutorials on Sails.js until I found this. There were some walls I had to get though due to various updates Sails have made over the months, but was a tremendous aid overall. It helped me understand the MVC architectural pattern as well as the CRUD paradigm.

[Model View Controller (Article - wiki.c2)](http://wiki.c2.com/?ModelViewController) - This helped me gain a slight understanding of what exactly Model View Controller means.
